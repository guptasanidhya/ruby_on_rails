#eql? checks both the value type and the actual value it holds.

5.eql?(5.0) #=> false; although they are the same value, one is an integer and the other is a float
5.eql?(5)   #=> true

#equal? checks whether both values are the exact same object in memory. This can be slightly confusing because of the way computers store some values for efficiency. Two variables pointing to the same number will usually return true.

a = 5
b = 5
a.equal?(b) #=> true
# This expression is true because of the way computers store integers in memory.
#  Although two different variables are holding the number 5, they point to the same object in memory. However, consider the next code example:

a = "hello"
b = "hello"
a.equal?(b) #=> false
# This happens because computers canâ€™t store strings in the same efficient way
#  they store numbers. Although the values of the variables are the same, the computer has created two separate string objects in memory.

a = "hello"
b = "hello"
c = "HELLO"
#compares values 
puts a.eql?(b)  # true
puts a.eql?(c)  # false (case-sensitive comparison)
# In the example, eql? returns true when comparing a and b because their values are the same. However, it returns false when comparing a and c due to case sensitivity.

x = "hello"
y = "hello"
z = x

puts x.equal?(y)  # false (different objects)
puts x.equal?(z)  # true (same object)
# In this example, equal? returns false when comparing x and y because they are different objects. It returns true when comparing x and z because they refer to the same object.
